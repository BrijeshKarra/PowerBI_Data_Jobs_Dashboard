## Introduction

_This dashboard invites you to visit the Job Variability in the world of Data Sciene and explore the How behind it._

## Project Summary
This project includes **two-page interactive Power BI dashboard** using a real dataset of 2024 data job postings, allowing users—especially tech job seekers—to explore key market trends such as job titles, salaries, and locations through clear and interactive visuals.



## Files Included
- [`Data_Jobs_Dashboard.pbix`](Data_Jobs_Dashboard.pbix) – Main Power BI report file

- [`Bonus Visuals Link`]- See at the end of page.

## Skills Practiced
- **Data Cleaning:**  Removed nulls, changed data types, and created calculated columns  
- **Visualizations:** Used bar, column, area, and map charts to highlight key metrics  
- **DAX Basics:** Built implicit measures to show job count and median salary  
- **Report Navigation:** Added drill-through functionality and bookmarks for smooth user interaction  
- **Design Principles:** Focused on layout clarity, slicer usability, and consistent formatting  

## Dashboard Pages
_This report is split into two distinct pages to provide both a high-level summary and a detailed analysis._



###  Page 1: Job Market Overview

Think of this page as a control panel for the data job market. It highlights essential metrics like job counts, salary trends, and top roles, offering a clear, high-level overview at a glance.

## Conclusion 

This dashboard shows how Power BI can turn raw job posting data into an interactive tool for career analysis.
