# Welcome To Bonus Visuals


## Some Key Info
On this page, you will see the behind the scenes footage or the workings done before I started working on the main dashboard and the Main Dashboard as well.

### PAGE 1: HOME

![Home](/Visuals/Bonus%20Visuals/Home.gif)

**This shows the different pages I worked on which ultimatley hepled in finalizing the main dashboard. Each tab is a button, when clicked while pressing CTRL key, it navigates to that page.**

### PAGE 2: COLUMNS & BARS
![Columns and Bars](/Visuals/Bonus%20Visuals/ColumnAndBar.png)
**This includes the different types on columns and bar but what shocks me the most is how the highest paying job- Senior Data Scientist, has almost the lowest number of job postings out of which almost all require a Degree. This shows the exclusivity of this role.**


### PAGE 3: LINE & AREA
![Line and Area](/Visuals/Bonus%20Visuals/LineAndArea.png)

**It's like Data Science Vs Earth Science**


### PAGE 4: COMMON CHARTS

### PAGE 5: TABLE AND MATRIX
![Table and Matrix](/Visuals/Bonus%20Visuals/TableAndMatrix.png)

**The Star Ratings in the main dashboard are derived from here**


### PAGE 6: CARDS
![Cards](/Visuals/Bonus%20Visuals/Cards.png)

**Cards are one of the best visuals in PowerBI, especially the Card which is new. The Gauge card (top right) is lierally why Dashboards are called Dashboards.**


### PAGE 7: SLICERS
![Slicers](/Visuals/Bonus%20Visuals/Slicers.png)

**Works the same as a filter but on the go.** 

### PAGE 8: DRAFTBOARD
![Cards](/Visuals/Bonus%20Visuals/Draftboard.png)


**This was the main dashboard before it became the Main Dashboard.**

## FINAL TWO PAGES

### PAGE X: MAIN DASHBOARD PAGE 2

**This page takes you to the advanced version of the main dashboard but at the cost of visiting only 1 Job AKA Job Drill-Through.**
